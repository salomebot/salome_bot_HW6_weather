Berkeley Data Analytics Homework 6 WeatherPy

Using the Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, I created a  Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. This script randomly select at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude and performs a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls. It includs e a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number, city name, and requested URL.
Save both a CSV of all data retrieved and png images for each scatter plot.
 
I built a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
